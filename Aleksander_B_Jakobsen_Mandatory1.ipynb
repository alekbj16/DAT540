    "For problem 1, two functions have been defined. The first one is used to prompt players for input. This function, called getUserInputs(), presents the choices to the players. The function further takes input arguments from the users, first from player 1, and then from player 2. For each given input, a while loop is used to re-prompt for input if the given input is unvalid. Valid inputs are pre-defined in the function. The function returns two variables; the choices of player 1 and player 2. \n",
